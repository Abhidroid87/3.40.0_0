# Manage ‚Äì Productivity Extension & GraphQL Platform

Manage is a Chrome-powered productivity hub with a Gemini-assisted dashboard, GraphQL sync pipeline, and a mobile companion (maintained in a separate repository). The extension now ships with an onboarded landing experience, Firebase-aware authentication, and health checks that keep local demo mode stable even when credentials are missing.

> The React Native client lives in its own repository. This workspace focuses on the extension, shared libraries, and backend prototype.

## ‚úÖ Quick-start checklist

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd extension
   npm install
   ```

2. **Provide environment variables** (skip for demo mode)
   ```bash
   cp extension/.env.example extension/.env
   # Fill in Firebase + Gemini keys when available
   ```

3. **Build the packed extension**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable *Developer mode*
   - Click *Load unpacked* ‚Üí select `extension/dist`

5. **Preview the landing experience**
   - Open a new tab; the Manage landing page appears until onboarding is completed
   - Sign in / sign up once Firebase is configured, or choose ‚ÄúExplore dashboard preview‚Äù to continue without credentials

6. **Run the backend prototype (optional)**
   ```bash
   cd packages/api
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## ‚ú® Highlights in this iteration

- **Landing page integration** ‚Äì The marketing site from the design prototype now renders inside the extension new tab, with a condensed CTA surfaced in the popup.
- **Onboarding state** ‚Äì `hasCompletedOnboarding` is persisted so users can revisit the dashboard after completing or skipping the landing flow.
- **Firebase health checks** ‚Äì The landing diagnostics card exercises Auth + Firestore connectivity via `testFirebaseConnection()`.
- **Guarded authentication** ‚Äì Firebase initialisation is optional. Auth UI communicates readiness and disables sign-in buttons until credentials exist. Successful sign-up/login automatically provisions a Firestore profile document.
- **Reusable profile service** ‚Äì `profileService.ts` keeps user documents up to date with `lastLoginAt` and display metadata.

| Area | Key files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landing & onboarding | `extension/src/components/LandingPage.tsx`, `extension/src/newtab/App.tsx`, `extension/src/popup/PopupApp.tsx` | Landing page shows before login; popup links back to it. |
| Dashboard | `extension/src/components/*`, `extension/src/store/appStore.ts` | Tasks, notes, AI suggestions reuse Zustand store + Tailwind UI. |
| Auth & profiles | `extension/src/services/authService.ts`, `extension/src/services/profileService.ts`, `shared/firebase` | Graceful fallback when Firebase is absent; Firestore profile auto-created. |
| Connectivity | `extension/src/services/connectionTest.ts` | Health check feeds the landing diagnostics card. |
| Shared utilities | `shared/utils/env.ts`, `shared/types` | Path alias `@shared/*` resolves via Vite + TypeScript config. |

## üîê Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FIREBASE_API_KEY` / `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase web key | Required for production auth; optional locally. |
| `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Standard Firebase config | All six keys supported. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini server fallback | Used when on-device Gemini Nano isn‚Äôt available. |
| `API_BASE_URL` / `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | GraphQL endpoint | Default: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`. |

> Without `.env` the extension runs in demo mode: local features remain available, authentication is disabled, and the landing page warns you about the missing credentials.

## üß™ Validation commands

```bash
# From /extension
npm run build        # Vite production build + manifest packaging
npm run lint         # optional TypeScript/ESLint pass
npm run type-check   # strict TypeScript validation
```

The build step writes `dist/manifest.json` with a module-based service worker entry so Chrome accepts ES module syntax.

## üìö Additional resources

- `extension/TASKS.md` ‚Äì running backlog and integration notes
- `shared/README.md` ‚Äì documentation for cross-platform helpers
- `packages/api/README.md` ‚Äì instructions for the GraphQL/Prisma playground

## üöÄ Roadmap highlights

- Wire up Apollo Client for GraphQL sync across extension + mobile
- Implement optimistic task/note mutations with conflict resolution
- Add vector embedding workers for note RAG + Gemini prompts
- Ship CI/CD: Docker image + GitHub Actions workflow (backend) and automated extension packaging

Enjoy the new onboarding flow! If you spot anything that prevents local setup, open an issue or drop a note in `TASKS.md`.<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> b1718923ca32fe5b9debe28414d3f8bb55644c86

A unified codebase that powers the Manage Chrome extension and the companion mobile application. Both workspaces share Firebase-backed data and Gemini AI helpers through a common `shared/` library.

## Repository Layout

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension/          # Chrome extension workspace (Vite + React)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile/             # React Native (Expo) mobile workspace
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Cross-platform Firebase, AI, and type modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/api/       # (Optional) Node API playground wired to shared helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

Each workspace owns its dependencies, tooling, and environment files. Shared utilities are authored in TypeScript and consumed via the `@shared/*` path alias.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Chrome (for the extension) and Expo Go or an emulator (for the mobile app)

### 1. Bootstrap Firebase & Gemini Credentials

Create environment files for both workspaces using the provided templates:

```
cp extension/.env.example extension/.env
cp mobile/.env.example mobile/.env
```

Populate them with your Firebase project details and a Gemini API key. The shared helpers accept both generic (`FIREBASE_API_KEY`) and Vite-prefixed (`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`) keys, so you can reuse the same values in every workspace.

### 2. Install Dependencies

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs new in this iteration?

- **Landing page integration** ‚Äì The marketing site from the design prototype is now part of the extension. It renders inside the new tab experience and inside the popup (as a condensed CTA) for first-time users.
- **Onboarding state** ‚Äì `hasCompletedOnboarding` is persisted across sessions so users can revisit the dashboard after opting in or skipping the landing flow.
- **Firebase health checks** ‚Äì The landing page includes a diagnostics widget that exercises Auth + Firestore connectivity via `testFirebaseConnection()`.
- **Guarded authentication** ‚Äì Firebase initialisation no longer crashes when `.env` is missing. Auth UI clearly communicates readiness and disables sign-in buttons until credentials are supplied. Successful sign-up/login automatically provisions a Firestore profile document.
- **Reusable profile service** ‚Äì `profileService.ts` keeps user documents up to date with `lastLoginAt` and display metadata.
